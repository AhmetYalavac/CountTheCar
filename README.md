Various operations can be applied to the image to achieve a smoother detection.


Assigning the verification lines created for real-time detection to a more general value instead of a video-specific setting would be more accurate. For example, we can derive this from the width and height values of the image. a simple calculation may not be sufficient, and therefore, I am considering making an update for this.
